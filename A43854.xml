         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>To this I adde the Teſtimony of the now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and Learned, the Right Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in God the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> of all <hi>Ireland,</hi> his Grace, A man equally Eminent for Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Piety, from whoſe mouth ſpeaking of this Gentleman in my hearing, did fall this great and gracious Teſtimony, that there was in him the very Beauty of holineſſe, and that
<pb facs="tcp:94522:6"/>he was of ſo amiable and cheerefull a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that when he lookt on him, he was put in mind of <hi>Moſes</hi> whoſe very face ſhined;<note place="margin">Exo 34.29 Index ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi vultus.</note> As ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring ſome more then ordinary eminency of grace in his heart, which was diſcoverable in the ſweetneſſe and cheerefulneſſe of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.

For being now for ripeneſſe of yeeres and maturity of age fit for marriage; his Father conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering he was the firſt borne of his ſtrength, the choiceſt plant of his ſtocke, and chiefeſt branch of his vine, began to caſt about where he might beſtow him, ſeat him and ſet him in the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Lord. After a while, by godly, and good meanes, a daughter of one <hi>M.Hardware,</hi> a worthy and wiſe Gentleman, having been twice Major of the city of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">His father beſtowes him in marriage, 1580.</note> was commended to the Father, and ſo by him motioned unto his Sonne.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94522:25"/>conſent of the Parents, they were matched and married together in the feare of God.</p>
               <p>This was a godly entrance upon Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, the whole carriage of the buſineſſe being ſo warrantable on all ſides, as that it was (through Gods bleſſing) in the proceeding, as well as in the beginning, moſt comfortable to all that had any part or portion in the ſame.</p>
               <p>For here the Father doth not marry his Sonne an infant, or under yeeres, before he have diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to know what he doth, and how to mannage that eſtate. Nor doth the Sonne, being come to yeeres, through the rage of luſt, ſteale himſelfe from his Father, and by wanton attempts, and raſh and fooliſh contracts, prevent his Fathers choice, and beſtow himſelfe at his owne pleaſure. Here the Father in a ſeaſonable time,<note place="margin">With a godly young gent.</note> without any long delayes, provides his Sonne a wife out of a good family, a godly young woman; for quality, and equality, birth and blood, yeeres and ſtate, true religion, and good diſpoſition, well conſorting to himſelfe and his Sonne.</p>

               <p>THis is then the ſumme of all, touching hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hawking, how farre they are lawfull or unlawfull in my opinion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is lawfull to hunt and to hawke for the taking of ſuch creatures as may be uſefull, or might be hurtfull unto us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is lawfull to take pleaſure in the naturall properties and qualities of ſuch crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as are uſed and exerciſed in hunting and hawking to that end: As in the ſent and ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Hound, the ſwiftneſſe of the Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94522:32"/>the ſoaring of the Falcon, and flight of the Hawke, the jumping of the Leopard, and ſpeed and ſtrength of the Horſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is lawfull, in hunting and hawking to uſe both naturall and artificiall inſtruments to take away the lives of ſome of the creatures, not only for our profit, but even for our pleaſure alſo.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is lawfull to hunt and hawke, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it as a recreation, not to be a Hunter, or a Faulkener, as making it a daily occupation.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, It is not lawfull to take pleaſure in the enmity of the creatures, nor to make their vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our recreation, putting them to unneceſſary and extraordinary paines in their life, and to like tortures in their death, for our ſport and pleaſure onely.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, It is not lawfull to ſpend more time, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſo much by much, in theſe recreations, as we muſt and ought to beſtow in our honeſt and lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and vocations: As no man that meanes to preſerve his health and ſtrength, will eat more of the ſweet ſawce, than of the wholeſome meat which is provided for him.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, It is unlawfull in and for our pleaſure in theſe exerciſes (which were intended eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for the refreſhing of mens mindes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of their ſtrength after honeſt ſtudies and labours) to overtoyle, and tire out our ſelves, as did <hi>Eſau</hi> in his hunting, even untill he was almoſt dead for hunger. Inordinate affections to theſe games, and immoderate paſſions in the croſſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currents of them, doe not onely marre all the ſport, but deprive us of all lawfull uſe and fruit of them.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:94522:33"/>
               <p>Eighthly, It is unlawfull, by hunting or hawk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to overcharge our ſtate, or endammage our neighbours, by Horſes and Hounds, coſtly at home, and cumberſome abroad, ſo as we are made leſſe able to doe good to them that need, or to our owne families, and more offenſive in doing hurt to them that might looke for better things from us.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the exerciſe of hunting hath beene held in it ſelfe not onely lawfull, but commendable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the ancient Romans, and by the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the wiſeſt States-men,<note place="margin">Athen.

               <p>
                  <hi>Sertorius</hi> a Romane Captaine and Commander,<note place="margin">Plutarch. in Sertorio.</note> by his travell and paines which he took in hunting, had ſo accuſtomed himſelfe to hard adventures, and dangerous and difficult paſſages, that by the nimbleneſſe and agility of his body, he was ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble either to aſſaile his enemies, or to winde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe out of their hands alſo, with ſo great facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if he were in danger or diſtreſſe, that he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercame them oftentimes (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth of him) rather by light skirmiſhes, than by open encounter, and publike fight.</p>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:94522:39"/>require of them. This alſo diſcovereth the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition of ſuch families,<note place="margin">A diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the miſery of unequall yokefel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in foure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</note> where the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours are unequally yoked, being diverſe both in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion and affection, touching matters of Religion; and ſo much diſtracted and diſordered in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſuch religious duties: as the Lord in their families requires at their hands, which I ſee not how it can poſſibly bee otherwiſe, when the husband drawes one way, and the wife another. As firſt, when the husband is an Atheiſt that calls not upon God, no prayer in his family, no thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving at his Table for his meate, no reading of holy Scripture: the wife a Papiſt, contenting her ſelfe with her blind devotions, upon her beads and bookes, in her private chamber and her cloſet, to feed and cheriſh her ſeduced heart, and corrupted humour therewithall. Secondly, when the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is a prophane <hi>Eſau,</hi> minding only earthly things, and embracing, like <hi>Demas,</hi> this preſent world, followeth with great eagerneſſe the profits and pleaſures of this life: the wife a godly matron like <hi>Sarah</hi> in her Tent, faithfull and painfull, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of her familie and friends, with <hi>Mart ha,</hi> and conſcionable of that one thing which is needfull, with <hi>Mary,</hi> having choſen the better part which ſhall not be taken from her. Thirdly, when one thinkes every little too much, or enough at leaſt, in Gods ſervice, the other thinks againe, all that they can doe too little, to teſtifie their thankfullneſſe and faithfullneſſe to God, in the religious duties of their families. Fourthly, when the one contents himſelfe with a forme of godlineſſe, putting a ſhag-hared ſervingman to read a few cold prayers, and a ſimple and ſilly childe to ſay grace, and ſo
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:94522:39"/>ſlubber over their morning and evening ſervice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as well pleaſed as if they had gotten <hi>Micha</hi> his <hi>Levite</hi> into their houſe, or one of <hi>Jeroboams</hi> prieſts to do them ſervice, in worſhipping the Calf which is ſet up amongſt them.</p>
               <p>The other is much blamed for that, rejecting all phariſaicall formality in religion, they deſire ſuch effectuall and powerfull meanes of grace, as may enable them to ſhew forth the power and fruit of godlines in a good converſation. Alas! what diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and contentions muſt here needs be? what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper and diſorder both in the governors, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of ſuch a family muſt needs ariſe? where husband and wife (who ſhould being yoke-fellows, draw equally in one yoke) are yet unequally yo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,<note place="margin">

As for their choice, this was wont to be his courſe. As he heard of any that began to ſet their faces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> or to look towards heaven, as if they meant in good earneſt to travell that way: or of ſuch as had travelled many Sabbath dayes journey that way already: his heart was preſently towards them, ſo that by good and faire meanes he endeavoured to draw ſuch into his ſervice, and if he had place of imployment for them, to plant them in his family, above any other perſons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.

                  </note> Among the reft he had one of ſpeciall note, an old diſciple like <hi>Mnaſon,</hi> as a father in his family to the reſt of his ſervants, his name <hi>Robert Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> but better knowne by the name of <hi>old Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> a man utterly unlearned, being unable to read a ſentence, or write a ſyllable: yet was he ſo well taught of God, that by his own induſtry and Gods bleſſing upon his minde and memory, he grew in grace as he did in yeeres, and became ripe in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and mighty in the Scriptures. Yea he was ſo well acquainted with the hiſtory of the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:94522:41"/>Bible, and the ſumme and ſubſtance of every Book and Chapter, that hardly could any ask him, where ſuch a ſaying or ſentence were, but he would with very little adoe, tell them in what Book and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they might finde it. Inſomuch that he became as a very profitable Index to the family, to call to minde what they had learned, and to recover what they had loſt by ſlip of memory: and not onely ſo, but a godly Inſtructor, and Teacher of young profeſſors alſo, to acquaint them with the Word, and to exerciſe their hearts unto godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, by the precepts and examples thereof, which he conſtantly did both at home and abroad, as he had leiſure and liberty ſo to do. Now if that which I have often heard be true, that <hi>Bonus Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualis,</hi> is <hi>Bonus Theologus;</hi> A good Text-man is a good Divine; then may <hi>Old Robert</hi> in our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey proceedings, be allowed for a Divine, and a Doctor alſo. He had many other good parts in him, a good gift in prayer, and praiſe, very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and well able to conferre of good things, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to heare the Word read or preached, and to help his own, and his friends memories by repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſome other means: as of a ſtrange Girdle which, as I ſhall ſhew you, he had framed for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to that purpoſe. The Girdle was of leather, long and large:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Old Robert</hi> his Girdle for help of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</note> ſo that for compaſſe it would go twice about him: This (for the help of his memory) he divided into ſeverall portions and parts (as a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter doth his Rule) and allotteth every Booke of the Bible in their order, to ſome of thoſe divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: As <hi>Geneſis</hi> to the firſt, <hi>Exodus</hi> to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, &amp;c. Then for the diſtinction of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of every Booke, he annexed a long point, or
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:94522:42"/>thong unto the ſeverall diviſions, and made knots by fives or tens thereupon, to diſtinguiſh the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters of that book, he had alſo other, either points or ruſhes to divide the chapters into their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular contents, or ſeverall parts, or verſes, as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion did require.</p>
               <p>This inſtrument of his owne invention, hee fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and uſed (as others do their pen and writing) for the better helpe of his underſtanding, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of his memory in his hearing of the Word preached; which he did with ſo good effect and fruit, in obſerving all the points and Scriptures al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged in a Sermon, and binding them upon the points, and partitions of his Girdle, as he heard them, that in repeating of the Sermon afterwards, he himſelfe had great benefit, and many other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, much comfort and helpe, by his handling of his girdle and fingering the points, and diviſions of it.</p>
               <p>A matter of ſuch wonder unto all that ever ſaw it, and heard him repeat a Sermon by it, that his worthy Maſter thought the girdle worthy to bee kept and reſerved in his Study, as a monument of Gods mercy and old <hi>Roberts</hi> both piety and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, that he might bee known to have beene nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther idle nor unprofitable in partaking of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the miniſtery.<note place="margin">A reb uke to mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and careleſſe perſons.</note> This man, and his girdle, ſhall riſe up in judgement againſt many of greater place than himſelfe, who being both mindleſſe in obſerving, and careleſſe in retaining what they heare, or have heard in the preaching of the Word, will neither ſtirre up the graces of God which are in them, nor exerciſe the naturall parts aright which God hath given them, nor practiſe any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall

This he did for their mutuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and contentment, in provoking one another to holy duties, and communicating ſuch things as they had read or heard, for increaſe of godlineſſe and goodneſſe one in another.</p>
               <p>Such is the nature and temper of humility and ſincerity. The maſter never a whit the more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed,

               <p>BUt now to leave old <hi>Robert</hi> in reſt and bliſſe with God, we are concerning his Maſter far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:94522:44"/>to underſtand, that albeit he ſhewed much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and love unto this ancient profeſſor his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſervant, yet did he wiſely proportion his regard and care of, and over the reſt, in their places, to their good contentment and his owne comfort. Some he made choice of to be neare about him for attendance,<note place="margin">Acts 10.7.</note> at home and abroad (and they ſuch as did feare God) as did that good <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who had ever devout men about him,<note place="margin">His due regard to the reſt of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</note> that waited on him continually. Theſe were more happy than their other fellow ſervants, becauſe they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with him, to whom hee was ever ready either to impart and offer ſome wholeſome words of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition or inſtruction, or to conferre, reaſon, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and anſwer in points of religion for increaſe of knowledge, conſcience and obedience, and that mutually and friendly,<note place="margin">Some at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending upon him.</note> as they did ſerve him at his Table or did walke or ride abroad with him. He never thought his Table better furniſhed, than when he had gracious and godly perſons to ſit with him, or ſtand about him, nor his meate better ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, than when it was poudered with ſuch ſalt of wholeſome words, and holy wiſedome as might miniſter grace unto the hearers that were preſent with him. <hi>Nullus enim ſuavior animo cibus eſt, quàm cognitio veritatis, Lact. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de falſa Reli.</hi> O how contrary unto this courſe, is their carriage, who like none ſo well, as a knave to attend them, a flatterer to humour them, and a foole to make them merry at their meate. It was the wiſdome of <hi>Salomon</hi> to ſpeake of wiſdome, both in naturall and ſpirituall things, even at his Table; in ſo much that the Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> admired what ſhe ſaw,<note place="margin">1 Kin. 10.8.</note> and heard; and reckoned his ſervants happy,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:94522:44"/>that might then ſtand before him and heare his wiſedome. Shall I crave leave of our wiſe men of the world, to tell them that in their courſes they come ſo farre ſhort, not only of <hi>Salomon,</hi> but even of this Gentleman, that they are not much better, than <hi>Salomons</hi> fooles, whoſe heads are ſo ſhallow,<note place="margin">Prov. 1.12. &amp; 9.6.</note> that they have no braines to ſpeake of knowledge, nor of any divine things: and their hearts ſo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty of grace and goodneſſe, that they take no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſuch company, nor in ſuch talke, and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at their tables, where they imagine they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be merry if God ſtand by, nor be at any quiet in their minde, if there bee any good man there, that offers any occaſion to ſpeake of holy and of heavenly things. Thus dealt he with the better ſort of his ſervants that were neare about him, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on him.<note place="margin">Some la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring for him.</note> And for the reſt that were imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his husbandry and buſineſſe abroad, hee was not forgetfull, but mindfull of their good. Hee allotted them their places according to their skill and knowledge, and proportioned their labour to their ſtrength, and their wages to their labour, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver allowing them liberty and leaſure, meanes and helpes to accompliſh the workes which they tooke in hand; and never ſuffering them to want any encouragement, which might make them chearfull and faithfull, in his, and Gods ſervice. To which end he would often (as other his greater oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions would permit) goe abroad amongſt them,<note place="margin">His over ſeeing of them, and wiſe deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them.</note> both to ſee the work, and to encourage the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. At which time, that both he and they might goe about earthly buſineſſe with heavenly mindes, he was wont to raiſe matter of ſpeech and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, ſometimes from their callings, workes, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:94522:45"/>ſometime from the good creatures of God, their nature, end, and uſe: ſometimes from the ſeaſon of the yeare, the Spring, Seedings, Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Harveſt, Winter, faire or foule weather, and the like; and to apply theſe to ſuch places of the Scriptures as they had heard or read the ſame things in, for their farther inſtruction and edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now for their work, what he ſaw was well for manner and matter, hee did likewiſe well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and accept; and by a due and kinde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of their care and paines, hee provoked them to continue in well doing. What he ſaw was amiſſe, if it were of ſmall moment, hee would wiſely paſſe by it, if of greater weight, he would admoniſh them of, and reprove them for it, yet not with any railing or reviling words (for ought that ever I could heare) but in words of wiſedome as became a holy man, and a good Maſter: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (it may be) more ſharpely, becauſe the nature of the fault, and diſpoſition of the offender, might ſo require it, and ſometimes more mildly, as hee found the party more ſenſible of his fault, and more tractable for amendment. There was not the meaneſt amongſt them, but hee would labour to cheare him, and encourage him in his ſervice: and if hee ſaw them any more towardly, in duties of Religion, hee would ſo much the more kindly ſpeak unto them, and more willingly confer with them. They did uſually alſo exerciſe themſelves unto godlineſſe, by mutuall exhortations, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, drawing on one another in every good way, and praying unto God in their courſes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the evening for a bleſſing upon their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and labours, which they ordinarily performed
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:94522:45"/>in the Kitchen, more privately, after prayer in the Parlour with the whole family.

For, 1. Such of his ſervants as were inclineable unto marriage, hee provided well for them, and ſent them out being married in the feare of God, to raiſe and eſtabliſh the worſhip of God in their owne houſes. And ſuch as were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle perſons,<note place="margin">By diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</note> as he had any mind to ſpare them and to part with them, he either beſtowed them in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther families, or ſuffered them to plant themſelves in ſuch houſes, where they might mutually both joyne, and joy together in Gods ſervice, to the ſpreading abroad of Religion, and farther inlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the kingdome of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Or diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his ſervants.</note> And then he made ſupply againe, by taking out of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey ſuch of their ſonnes and daughters, as were fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt for his planting or watering in that part of the Lords Vineyard, or for ſowing or ſetting in the Lords field.</p>

To which end and purpoſe, he built him a Pulpit in a Chappel in his owne houſe, and for a ſeaſon maintained the Preacher there, ſo that (as hee ſaith himſelfe) hee had good company every Sabbath day.<note place="margin">He main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Preacher in his own family.</note> This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as I doubt not but it was much to his comfort, ſo could it not bee, but much to his coſt alſo, when, amongſt a multitude, though ſome might come to the Chappell with good mindes, to feed their ſoules, yet others would bee as willing and ready to preſſe into the Hall to fill their bellies. And yet was he well contented to be at this charge alſo, for the increaſe of Religion and further of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>But he could not long make ſuch an incloſure of the Word, nor ſo confine it to his private family;

Now, God forbid, that they that profeſſe the feare of God, and beare the name of Chriſt, ſhould ever ſo farre for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their communion with God, as to have any fellowſhip with Divels, or ſo forſake the Lord the Fountaine of living waters, and digge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelves broken Ciſternes that can hold no water.</p>
               <p n="7">7 That uſually ſuch aſſemblies upon ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, are for the moſt part, a confluence of all vaine and vile perſons, a concurrence of all vices, a combination of the Popiſh and prophane, a very randavous of all rogues, and vagabonds, and many times no better, than as the Prophet ſpeaketh, a very aſſembly of rebels againſt the Lord. Now, wee are charged to depart from the tents of ſuch wicked men, to ſeparate our ſelves from ſinne and ſinners, not ſo much as to cate, or drinke with ſuch perſons, to hate the garment ſpotted by the fleſh, and to touch no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane thing, if ever we will have the Lord to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us, and to take us for his ſons and daughters.</p>

               <p n="8">8 That the attendants and conſequents, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and fruits of ſuch Wakes, and Idol-Feaſts, are commonly as baſe and bitter, as the ſonnes of <hi>Beliall</hi> can beget, or the vines of <hi>Sodome</hi> or <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah</hi> can bring forth: ſuch as are ſwearing, and blaſpheming; drunkenneſſe, and ſurfetting; braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and quarrelling; wantonneſſe, and unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; riot, and exceſſe in all manner of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ungodlineſſe; ſeldome any ſuch mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, but they either are ſprinkled with blood, or ſpotted with ſome groſſe filthineſſe. Now, what honeſt heart can abide in thoſe places, or endure thoſe perſons, that will bee ſure to vex his ſouls with their wicked converſation, and grieve his ſpirit, with that which hee ſhall daily and hourely heare and ſee amongſt them. <hi>Woe is mee</hi> (would <hi>David</hi> ſay) <hi>that I am conſtrained to dwell in Meſeck, and to have my habitation in the Tents of Kedar.

               <p>Thus much we can ſay for divers of our Divines, ſome Doctors, Parſons, and Preachers in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: They are ſo ordinary Companions of Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, ſorting and ſuteing with ſome of greater, and ſome of meaner place in Carding, Dicing, and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling with them, that they ſeeme to make no more conſcience of breaking theſe Canons, than children do of breaking ſticks, or Boyes are wont to do of burſting through Cobweb-nets as they ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</p>
               <p>O that theſe men (otherwiſe learned and of good parts) would ſeriouſly conſider their owne ways in their own hearts, and not diſdaine to walke according to this Rule, nor to follow this good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of this worthy Gentleman, of whom wee write.

               <p>There are divers things in this relation very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, which may not well be paſſed over in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; tending ſo much both to his juſt commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and to our information, and edification in the Faith and feare of God,</p>
               <p n="1">1 As firſt, that, Although the Lord was pleaſed ſundry times to exchaunge his comforts with croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, yet was he never changed, nor moved from his ſteadfaſtneſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, in all his afflictions he was willing to be humbled, but never dejected nor diſcouraged, having learned in what eſtate ſo ever he was, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be content.</p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:94522:81"/>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, that where ever he was at home or abroad, in city or countrey, his deſires, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, were ever bent to doe good, remembring the words of our Lord Jeſus, that it is a more bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thing to give than to receive.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Fourthly, that where ever he went, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he did, the preſence of the Lord Jeſus was with him, and his good hand upon him, to proſper him in all his wayes, and to ſtrengthen his hand and heart in well doing.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Fifthly, that in every place he became a nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing father to the children of God,<note place="margin">Eſay 22.23.24.</note> whether they were babes, or ſuch as were of riper age in Chriſt: yea he was as a naile of the Sanctuary, faſtened in a ſure place, upon which men did hang all veſſels of ſmall quantitie, from the veſſels of cups, even to all the veſſels of flaggons, as the Prophet ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Sixthly, that notwithſtanding all his great expenſes, both in city and countrey, in maintaining the poore, and entertaining of good people, yet his eſtate was not impaired, but increaſed, the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God inlarging his ſubſtance and his ſtore, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is written, Godlineſſe is profitable for all things, having the promiſe both of this life and of that which is to come.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Seventhly, that in all bleſſings and comforts, whether corporall, or ſpirituall, upon himſelfe, or upon others by his meanes, his heart (taſting and reliſhing the love of God in them) was marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly enlarged in rendering and returning all thanks and praiſe unto God alone, even for the leaſt of them.</p>
               <p>Thus farre hath this worthy Gentleman holpen us to ſpin out the thread of his owne life, with his
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:94522:82"/>owne fingers, and to make up (as it were) the web thereof with his owne hands. But as the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and curious workmanſhip of a cloth of Arras, is but little ſeene and diſcerned, while it is in the Loomes, or when it lyeth folded, and rolled up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; but when it is opened in a faire light, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played at large, and expoſed to the view of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, then the art and skill of the work man doth more evidently appeare, in great beauty, and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of knots and flowers, Pomegranets and Lillies, pictures and pourtraitures of princes and great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, and the like. Even ſo the ſtory of this Gentlemans life, thus woven and wrapped up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, though it containe many excellent things, of great value and worth in it, yet cannot the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and glory of his particular gifts and graces, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and ſervices, bee ſo well diſcerned and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, unleſſe it be yet a little farther opened and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded, and ſet forth to the view of ſuch men, as deſire and delight to look into ſuch things.</p>

               <p>And as he gave him wiſdome and knowledge, ſo did he alſo courage and ſtrength to mannage a Chriſtian life, and to fight valiantly the battels of the Lord, againſt all the aſſaults of Satan, and of

                  <note place="margin">His fits and paſſions.</note> His fits and paſſions were much after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Being brought ſo low, ſo weak, and feeble for any naturall ſtrength that hee was nothing (as we ſay) but skin and bones; yet for the ſpace of 24 houres every day (having one halfe houre which they called: his awakening time, wherein they gave him a little refreſhing by ſome food to ſuſteine him) he ſhewed himſelfe to be of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſtrength, that if he would fold his hands together, no man could pull them aſunder, if he did roll his head, or toſſe his whole body (as uſually he did) no man could ſtay, or reſtrain him; hee would with marvellous aſtoniſhment to the hearers, and beholders, ſomtimes howle like a Dog, mew like a Cat, roare like a Beare, froth and ſome like a Boare. When any prayed
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:94522:88"/>with him, his paſſions were the ſtrongeſt, and his rage and violence the greateſt, ready to fly in their faces, and to drown their voyces by his cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, yellings and outcries. If one came neare him with a Bible though under his cloak, and never ſo ſecret, yet would he run upon him, and ramp upon him, with great violence, to have gotten it from him, and to rend it in peeces, as he did divers, when hee could come unto them. Sometimes he would lye along, as if he had been ſtark dead, his colour gone, and mouth ſo wide open, that he would on a ſuddeine thruſt both his hands at once into it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">His geſtures and actions.</note> And as for his geſtures they were marvellous ſtrange.

And that which maketh the matter yet more admirable, having all this while his legs grown up cloſe unto his buttocks, whereof he could now have no preſent uſe for ſuch feats of activity: Sometimes we ſaw his chin drawn up unto his noſe, ſo that his mouth could ſcarce be ſeen; Sometimes his chin and brows drawn almoſt together, like a bended Bow.

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:94522:88"/>and all his men were affraid, and one of them fell into a ſownd, and then ſuch a ſtir about him, that the Biſh. was glad to lay hold on the boy, ramping at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows to have gotten out that way.

               <p>Now as for his Speeches ſtrange in themſelves,<note place="margin">3 His Speeches.</note> yet more ſtrange in this, that hee never uttered any of them, but when he was in his fits, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any underſtanding or knowledge of what he did, or what he ſaid:</p>
               <p>I will give you a taſte of ſome few of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeſus ſaith</hi> (ſo he uſually began his Speeches) <hi>The Devill when he comes, takes away my hearing, ſeeing, underſtanding, hands, legs, that I ſhould have no ſenſes, nor lims, to glorifie God withall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeſus ſaith, If they would have caſt out the evill ſpirit, they ſhould have come better provided.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeſus ſaith, Some men did think that he that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed had a better Faith than the other, but he had not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeſus ſaith, I have but three Divels, It is like one of the ſpirits will go out of me, and go and take counſel of a great number of foule spirits, and come againe and trouble me worſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeſus ſaith, Some folke will ſay that the Witch will not looke one in the face, but ſhee will look here a way and there a way.</hi> And ſo he turned his hands this way and that way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeſus ſaith, The witch ſaith ſhee hath done mee no hurt that ſhe knows of. A witch may overlook a child, but ſhee cannot make him in ſuch a caſe as I am in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Devill is affraid when hee heares any word that he muſt be caſt out, then he quakes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ieſus ſaith, Now the witch would faine undo
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:94522:89"/>that which ſhee hath done, but now ſhee cannot undo it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeſus ſaith, Some ſay, if I were bewitched or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, I could neither move my tongue, nor my lips: But the Devill can move both my tongue and my lips.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Satan I am bound to a hard prentice-ſhip, for thou wilt not give me leave neither holy-day, nor work-day to eat a morſell of bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Papiſt that brought the ſtinking weed and laid it to my noſe, if God had not had a ſtroke in this, would have cast out the Devill. And a boy was confederate with him. Now the Devill is poſſeſſed of their ſoules; And he muſt continue a little while with me, but a great while with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God puls the Devill back with a ring in his noſe, yet the Devill ſhakes my faith as if it would go out of mee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They may know there is ſome ill thing in mee, for when I ſhould ſay may prayers, he would come up and ſtop me, and then I muſt ſtay a little, and then again, and he would ſtay me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Being in a ſore fit and a great rage, biting his own hands, gnaſhing with his teeth foming like a boare and caſting blood and filth out of his mouth, hee uttered theſe words, Proud witch, witch proud, I will tell you who theſe witches work: all upon life, all upon life, all upon life; but they cannot take my life from me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Well, theſe drunkards &amp; whoremaſters do not think upon their ſins; well, how then? There is no drunkard that doth drink one ſpoonefulor drop of drink more than doth ſuffice nature, but the Devill doth pen it down in his book: Well, it is a great book, and he doth keep it cloſe untill the day of Indgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:94522:90"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>And then he will lay it to their faces. At which time the hils will tremble and quake, and the Devill will quake, yea he doth quake for feare now.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Well, ſome would think it a great while to be bound with the Devill as I am, a</hi> 12 <hi>month or</hi> 2 <hi>yeares; but it is better to bee ſo, than to wallow in drunkenneſſe, ſwearing, and whoring; for the Divell doth worke in their ſoules.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Well, ſome will ſay, how can the Devilly in ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a room? Well, the Devill is as the wind, for when he did take a man away out of a chamber, be came in at the little hole; but how did he take him away? e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out at the top of the chimney.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Well, there are ſome Papiſts, and ſome Atheiſts, and ſome of no Religion; woe be to thoſe that dye ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, for they have no time to repent, and eſpecially thoſe that live in drunkenneſſe, or whoring, or ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ieſus ſaith, they ſay hee ſhall not out of me, but when God comes he will ſtrike home.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many and many other more of his ſtrange ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches I paſſe over, contenting my ſelfe with theſe few, which were taken from his own mouth by the hand, &amp; under the teſtimony of faithfull wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, ſome at one time and ſome at another, as he himſelf did then deliver them, and as this worthy Gentleman hath in his diligent Obſervation of this, amongſt other of Gods Iudgements, made mention of them and recorded them.</p>
               <p>This therefore that hath been ſpoken ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, concerning the ſecond daily duty, which this Gent performed, namely, his carefull obſervation of Gods ways and works, mercies, and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments amongſt the ſons of men.</p>

               <p>And this he deſired and endevored to perform, according to the Apoſtles direction;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.8.</note> In every place lifting up pure hands without wrath or doubting, that is, in faith and love.</p>

               </p>
               <p>If he were in his own houſe or about home, he had divers places which he interchangeably uſed for this purpoſe, becauſe hee would not bee too much obſerved to frequent one place, leſt he ſhould draw himſelf into ſome ſuſpition of vanity or hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie. Hee had variety of Cloſets, Studies, Chambers, and other convenient roomes if hee were within: and if he went abroad, he had his Gardens, Orchards, Arbors, Groves, Woods and Fields, Walkes and Shades, where he did delight to ſpeak and commune with his beſt friend, and to ſeek the face and favor, help and ſuccour of his heavenly Father, in and through the mediation of his Son Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
               <p>And as he was choice of the place, ſo was hee carefull of the time which he conſtantly ſet apart every day for his private prayer,<note place="margin">His time for private praver.

Seven times a day.</note> and praiſe: 7 times a day did hee reverently and conſcionably performe this duty, cauſing his prayers to aſcend as incenſe, and the lifting up of his hands to be as an Evening Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>The ſeverall ſeaſons and times he tooke were theſe: The firſt in the morning, before any of his family were ſtirring, being uſually firſt up in the houſe,<note place="margin">Pſa 55.27.7</note> and that both Summer and Winter. The ſecond was before his breake-faſt after prayer in his family. The third was immediatly before dinner. The fourth a little while after dinner. The fiſt a little before ſupper. The ſixt not long after ſupper. And the ſeventh, a little before hee tooke his Chamber to go to his reſt. Neither was
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:94522:91"/>he only ſo plentifull for the number of his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Devotions, as he was (by the grace of God) powerfull in the manner, meaſure, end, and iſſue of them.<note place="margin">Powerful in prayer.

And herein we are the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther induced thus to thinke, becauſe uſually, his prayer was fortified by Faith, ſupported by Hope, inflamed with Zeale, beautified with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, purified by Sincerity, and eſtabliſhed by Conſtancy.

The power of grace had now abated much of the violence of his paſſions, and the ſweet influence of Gods Spirit had taken away the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and virulency of them; ſo that now they were of a better temper, ordered by a better rule, and directed to a better end; and were made as it were hewers of wood, and drawers of water, as <hi>Ioſhua</hi> made the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi>

               <p>Full of Mercy and of good Fruits.<note place="margin">Iam. 3.17 Mat. 5.45. Luk. 6.36.</note>

               <p>He was a Branch of that noble Uine Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, from whom he drew ſuch ſap of grace and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, by the power of faith, that hee was filled with the fruits of righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, to the praiſe and glory of God.</p>
               <p>A Branch clogged with fruit, like that which was cut downe at the Brooke <hi>Eſhcol,</hi> which was ſo loaden with one cluſter of Grapes, that it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for two men to bear it on a ſtaffe betweene them.</p>
               <p>He was one of the Trees of righteouſneſſe, the planting of the Lord, whoſe leafe was ever greene, whoſe fruit did never faile, ever bearing his owne fruit, good fruit, much fruit, and even in his age
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:94522:104"/>more and more fruit, being ever full and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the courts of our God.<note place="margin">Full of good fruits towards all.</note>
               </p>
               <p>He was full of Mercy and of good fruits, towards ſinners, and towards ſaints, towards neighbours, and towards ſtrangers, towards friends, and towards foes, towards the poore, and towards the rich, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all ſorts and conditions of men, as he had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and ability, ſo to declare himſelfe unto them.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe the good Tree is knowne by his Fruit, and the true Uine by her ſweete Grapes:<note place="margin">Mat. 12.33</note> we will take a view of ſome of his fruits of Mercy, and try what their taſte and reliſh is; that ſo finding them to be wholeſome and ſavoury (as no doubt we ſhall) wee may judge aright of the tree that did beare them, and of the branch that brought them to our hands.</p>
               <p>Some of the fruits of Mercy which hee ſhewed forth in his holy converſation,<note place="margin">He did mourne for ſinners</note> were directed unto ſuch as were yet in their ſins, blind, ignerant, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh, or prophane. Such as were without meanes of grace, being without God, and without Chriſt, how would his bowels of compaſſion yern within him,<note place="margin">Mat. 9.36. Exod. 32. Mar. 3.5.

How, often as he hath by occaſion ſeene them in the midſt of their Heatheniſh ſports, and Idolatrous feaſts, either kiſſing the Calves, or dancing about them, hath be looked angerly upon them, and ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken roughly unto them, yet mourning for the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their hearts, which was upon them, and as it were bleeding inwardly, for the wickedneſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by them?</p>
               <p>If he by occaſion did meet with ſuch perſons as were mockers, contemners of God, and deſpiſers of

               <p>But if he found any poore ſoules erring from the right way, yet deſiring a guide (as the Eunch did) to bee directed unto it,<note place="margin">Act. 8.31. Prov. 2.1, 2, 3, 4.

He would deal ſo choiſely and tenderly, ſo mercifully and wifely with them, by his wholeſome inſtructions, loving admonitions, godly exhortations, and good directions; that hee did nouriſh and cheriſh them in religion, as the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Babes,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 2.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If hee had ſeene a profeſſor of religion in ſome decay and want for outward things, he would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to relieve him, by his own, and other good means,<note place="margin">For ſupply of their wants.</note> according to his preſent occaſions, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities.

The care of all the Churches about him was daily and continually upon him, ſo that he might ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Who is weake, and Jam not weake? Who is offended, and I burne not?</hi> This fruit of his compaſſion and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affection to Gods children, did more eſpecially appeare, when he heard of heavy newes out of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia, Hungary, Germany,</hi> the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> &amp;c. He
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:94522:108"/>was then ſo affected therewithall, as good <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> was, when he heard by <hi>Hanani,</hi> one of his brethren, that the remnant of the <hi>Iewes</hi> were in great affliction, that the wall of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was broken downe,<note place="margin">And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict him alſo.</note> and the gates thereof were burnt with fire: For then he ſate downe, and wept, and mourned certaine dayes, and faſted, and prayed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the God of heaven.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It did alſo no leſſe evidently appeare,<note place="margin">His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion in viſiting the ſick;</note> by his diligent and carefull viſiting of the ſicke, and ſuch perſons and families as had ſome more heavie and extraordinary hand of God upon them.

His godly exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, wholeſome admonitions, divine inſtructions, ſweet words of comfort; but eſpecially his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and fervent prayers, were many times, as ſo many gracious remedies againſt their grievous mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and maladies. And to ſpeak as the truth is, as his gifts were rare, and paines great, in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of theſe duties, ſo was the iſſue and ſucceſſe thereof (through the bleſſing of God) many times anſwerable, and effectuall, either for ſome full releaſe, or ſome reliefe in due ſeaſon. Hereof he hath witneſſes enow, over all the countrey, and many he hath written downe, of ſuch and ſuch mercies, obtained of God by his good meanes, for ſuch and ſuch perſons: the glory where of he doth
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:94522:109"/>ever in great humility aſcribe unto the Lord, giving him all hearty thankes, and praiſe, that would ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his great mercy, grace, power, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to ſo weake creatures, by ſo weak meanes.</p>

                  <note place="margin">His anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> Now as he held a holy Sympathy with the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo had he a great antipathy againſt the profane, both perſons and faſhions, cuſtomes and courſes of the world. He knew well, that <hi>the faſhion of this world paſſeth away, and the luſt thereof, but he that doth the will of God, abideth for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He knew well alſo, that not onely he himſelfe, but all true Chriſtians are forbid by the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,<note place="margin">In gariſh faſhions.</note> to faſhion or conforme themſelves to this world, and injoyned to be transformed in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of their minde, that they may prove what is that good, that acceptable and perfect will of God.</p>
               <p>And therefore he could never be brought into any love, or liking of the gariſh, fooliſh, vaine and new-fangle faſhions of the world in attire, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ridiculous geſtures, and formall complements of the profane of this world, but did in his heart abhorre them, and in his life utterly ſhun and avoid them.</p>
               <p>Being once at an high Sheriffes feaſt, where there were ſome Lords, Spirituall and Temporall, as they are called, and many other Knights and gentlemen of great place, there was an health begun by one of the Lords,<note place="margin">In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, as in drinking of healths.</note> to the Prince, which after the manner, was entertained and maintained with a great deale of ceremoniall ſolemnity; As it went along, and drew neare unto him (many obſerving what he would ſay or doe) he caſt out in a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate manner ſome words of diſlike to this effect:
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:94522:109"/>Here is a ſolemne ſervice to the Prince, yet did he never require it, nor will ever give you any thankes for it. And when one preſſed him to pledge and drinke to the Princes health: he made this milde and gentle anſwer onely: You may drinke to his health, and I will pray for his health, and drink for mine owne,<note place="margin">Nos cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus pro ſalute im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratoris, &amp;c <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tull.</hi> ad Scapul.c. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> and ſo I wiſh you may doe for yours. And ſo he put it off, and paſſed it over, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſorting with them, nor yeelding to any one of their ſolemne ceremonies in that act. He did beare a more generous minde, than to be brought in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection unto every idle fancy and foolery, or to conforme himſelfe unto the humours and cuſtomes of profane men.</p>

               <p>ANother, one of the laſt,<note place="margin">Fruits of mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Tenants.</note> upon the leaſt of thoſe good fruits, where with this goody Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (of whom we write) was filled, was his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull dealing with his Tenants, towards whom hee did ever beare a very tender, and compaſſionate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and regard. He did not grind the faces of the poore, by great fines, nor cruſh their bones by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rents and rackes, and ſometimes three yeares rent together, at the marriage of a daughter,<note place="margin">Amos 4.1. Mich. 2.2. Mich. 3.2.</note> nor breake their backes with bundens of oppreſſion in all manner of cruell ſervices (as the manner of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was round about him, toyling the bodies and tyring out the beaſts of their poore Tenants) Hee did not uſe their labour without hire, nor call for their worke without wages, nor take the benefit of their travell without any allowance of neceſſary ſaſtenance (which is the ſinne and ſhame of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gentlemen amongſt as) But in all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corning their profit, their eaſe, their peace, their Chriſtian comfort, and contentment, hee ever carried himſelfe as a mercifull,<note place="margin">He was a mercifull Landlord.</note> and good Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord towards them. Yea, it was the very joy of his heart to ſee his Tenants proſper and thrive, in their eſtate under him, and to entertaine them lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly and uſe them kindly as they came unto him. Hee was much of the fame minde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Tenants,<note place="margin">Sueton. in Auguſt.</note> as <hi>Augustus</hi> was towards his Subjects; Hee would not have any to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:94522:112"/>come in feare and trembling before him, as if they came to an Elephant, nor any to depart with a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie heart, of ſad couritenance from him, as if they had beene with a Tyrant.</p>
               <p>How contrary to theſe mercifull courſes, are the rigorous, and cruell dealings of ſome Land-lords, with their Tenants, who if they grow wealthly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, they are uſed and ſqurezed as ſpunges, as <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> did his Officers,<note place="margin">Sueton on Veſp.</note> to wreſt and wring what they can from them. If their Leafes be expixed they will hardly renew them, but upon ſuch hard condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as they ſhall never be able to live under them. Nay it may be they will grant no Leaſe at all, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for yeares, nor lives, but thruſt out the ancient Tenant, and ſet his living upon a rack (for the rack ſay they, is the caſieſt pace) and ſo pull downe other mens houſes and families, to build their owne neſts on high; impoveriſh others to inrich themſelves; thruſt others into corners, that they may enlarge their owne borders;<note place="margin">Mic. 2.2.</note> and make other men their ſlaves and drudges,<note place="margin">Iſa. 5.</note> that they may domineere, and dwell alone as Lords of the land bound about them.</p>
               <p>The woe that is denounced by the Prophet <hi>Iſay,</hi> and by others alſo as well as by him, againſt ſuch ſins, makes me to thinke, that ſuch cruell Land-lords, will nor find in the end, the racke to bee the eaſieſt pace as they imagine, nor the grinding of the poore to be their ſweeteſt griſt, as ſome conceive. No, no, I rather feare that all the eaſe of ſuch a rack will be no other, but to amble with the world, to trot on with the wicked, to gallop to the divel, and to take up their lodging in hell where they have a place prepared for them.</p>
               <p>But wee ſpeake to them that have no eares to
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:94522:112"/>heare what the Spirit ſpeakes unto the Churches, but are rather like the deafe Adder,<note place="margin">Caſsied in Pſal. <hi>57.</hi> Lyva in Pſal. <hi>57.</hi>
                  </note> of which <hi>Caſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odore</hi> reporteth, that when ſhe is likely to bee char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſhee makes her ſelfe deafe, by ſtopping one eare with the earth, and the other with her taile, that ſhee may not heare the voice of the charmer, charme he never ſo wiſely.</p>
               <p>Thus have we made it manifeſt, that this gracious and Godly Gentleman, was in his holy converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, full, of mercy and full of good fruits.</p>
               <p>All of which do taſte and reliſh ſo much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe they were ſeaſoned with two other gracious qualities, of that wiſedome which is from above, namely, Equity, and Syncerity, for hee was without partiality, and without hypocriſie: Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of the Prophet <hi>Micha, He hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee O man what is good, and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to doe juſtlie, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly and uprightly with thy God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus have we according to our purpoſe and promiſe, taken a more ſpeciall view of ſome parts and paſſages of this Gentlemans life, wherein the gifts of Gods grace, the vertues of Chriſt, and the fruits of the Spirit, did more eminently appear. As firſt, in his converſing with God; and ſecondly, in his converſation in the world. And ſo wee come from the courſe of his life in the world, and draw towards the end of his life; namely, his departure out of the world: which was the third and laſt of thoſe 3. generall heads, which were propoſed to be handled.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Now for the firſt, as his whole life was a medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of death, ſo was it alſo a continuall preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for it. For the Lord had taught him ſo to number his dayes, that he did apply his heart unto wiſdome.

Al his ſtudies and labours, all his holy duties and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, all his prayers and tears, all his watchings and faſtings, all his deſires and endeavors, were eſpecially bent and directed unto this end (next unto Gods glory,) that he might ſo run, that he might obtaine, and ſo fight,<note place="margin">His prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for death.</note> that he might overcome, and in the end, be more than a conquerour in him that loved him, that is in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>

<list>
                     <item>1. To deny himſelf, his wit, his will, his reaſon, and affection.</item>
                     <item>2. To renounee the world, and to we are himſelfe from the love of it, and from all the pleaſures, profits, honours, and favours of the fame.</item>
                     <item>3. To ſet and ſettle his affections on the things which are above, placing his heart where his head Chriſt is.</item>
                     <item>4. To take all his decayes of nature, his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily infirmities, want of vigour and ſtrength, abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of naturall heate and moiſture, to be certeyne Impreſſions of his mortality, and evident Summons to a diſſolution.</item>
                     <item>5. To make all his ſpirituall rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings and refreſhings in the eſtate of grace, to bee pledges, and earneſts (as it were) of heavenly and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting joy and happineſſe in the eſtate of glory.</item>
                     <item>6. To conſider, that unto the godly, death is but a paſſage unto life, a diſſolution of ſoule and body for a ſeaſon, which afterwards ſhall bee reſtored again in greater beauty and glory at the reſurrection.</item>
                     <item>7. To obſerve, that death puts an end to all ſins and ſorrows, to all temptations, and afflictions, and brings us into the poſſeſſion of an heavenly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, where the true treaſure is in abundance, where alſo there are rivers of pleaſures, and fulneſſe
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:94522:114"/>of joy for ever more.</item>
                     <item>8. To meditate, that here we are but ſtrangers and pilgrims, having here no continuing city, but ſeeking one to come, that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is our home, and that whiles we are preſent in the body, we are abſent from the Lord, and that <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> which is above, is the city of the Saints, and mother of us all.</item>
                     <item>9.

To which end the Lord had given him a great meaſure of ſpirituall ſtrength,<note place="margin">Phil. 4.13 Eph. 6.13</note> that he was able to doe (in a manner) all things in Chriſt which ſtrengthened him, and hee had furniſhed him alſo with that<gap reason="foreign">

So that now he was able with valiant <hi>David,</hi> to goe forth in the name of the Lord, even againſt <hi>Goliah</hi> of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims.</hi> And grew reſolute with <hi>Paul,</hi> not to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon his life deare unto him (whatſoever afflictions might befall him) ſo that he might fulfill his courſe with joy,<note place="margin">Act. 20.24 Ro. 8.18.</note> Accounting all the afflictions of this world to be unworthy of the glory that ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, and never fainting for any ſorrow, becauſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the outward man did periſh and decay, yet was his inward man renewed daily,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.16.17.</note> and all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of this life were but light and momentany to him, that had an eye to the eternall vveight of glory, laid up in heaven for him.</p>

               <p>About the fifteenth of <hi>Ianuary</hi> his ſtrength was much abated, and his weakneſſe increated, by reaſon of a ſore ſtopping in his breaſt and throate, which did ſo trouble him, that hee could take no food, nor refreſhing, no not ſo much as a Spoone-full of any Syrup, or broth or any other liquid thing: but he was ready to faint and to be gone upon it.</p>

                  <note place="margin">His laſt Prayer.</note> 
                  <hi>my help and my truſt, his bleſſed ſon Jeſus is my Saviour and Redeemer, Amen, Even ſo ſaith the Spirit unto my ſpirit: Therefore, come Lord Jeſus, and kiſſe me with the kiſses of thy mouth, and embrace me with the armes of thy love: Into thy hands do I commend my ſpirit; O come now, and take me to thine own ſelfe; O come, Lord Jeſus, come quickly, O come, O come, O come,</hi> And ſo his ſpirit fainting,<note place="margin">His laſt end</note> and his ſpeech failing, he lay quiet and ſtill, for a little ſeaſon. And then he meekly, and graciouſly yeelded up his pretious ſoule, into the hands of God his Father that gave it, and into the armes of his Saviour, that had bought it, and redeemed it with his pretious bloud.</p>
               <p>And thus having finiſhed his courſe, and run out his race, the night of his death ſhutting up
